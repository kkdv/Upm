The organs called kidneys are vital to life, as they filter bad stuff from your blood, help your body get rid of waste, regulate your blood pressure, and even produce hormones. The word kidney is probably a compound of the Old English cwi√∞, "womb," and ey, "egg," describing the organ\'s shape.',

On top of that, JavaScript is a great language for beginners because it gives them a chance to write code that does something visual, which is exciting and helpful when you're just getting started as a programmer. Dynamic content is the hot topic in web development right now. Dynamic content refers to content that constantly changes and adapts to specific users whenever possible. For example, JavaScript can be used to determine if a website visitor is using a computer or a mobile device before deciding whether or not to render the mobile version of the website. It's these small things behind the scenes that create genuine value in using JavaScript to create dynamic web pages.",
